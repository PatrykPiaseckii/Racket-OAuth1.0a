# OAuth 1.0a in Racket 
#### by Stephen Baldwin


The Racket Language currently only has an OAuth 2.0 library. Considering that major companies such as Twitter, Tumblr, Netflix, and Vimeo still use OAuth 1.0a for API authentication, I believe this to be a problem. And so for my senior project I decided to write a library that would allow people to communicate with these APIâ€™s via OAuth 1.0a in the Racket language. 

This report will give some background information on the OAuth 1.0a protocol and process for authentication. It will also outline what I completed for my senior project as well as what still needs to be done for this library to be robust.
